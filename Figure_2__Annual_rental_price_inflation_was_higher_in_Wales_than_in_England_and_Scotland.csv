3.  The [Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Scotland Act](https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/cost-of-living-tenant-protection-scotland-bill) passed on 6 October 2022, introducing a temporary rent cap in the private rented sector in Scotland. This cap, which applies to in-tenancy rent increases, was initially set at 0% for rent-increase notices served from 6 September 2022 until 31 March 2023. Private landlords could alternatively apply for a rent increase of up to 3% to help cover certain increases in costs in defined and limited circumstances. The Act has since been extended to 31 March 2024, with a mid-tenancy rent-increase cap of 3% from 1 April 2023. Private landlords are able to apply for a rent increase of up to 6% to help cover certain increases in costs in defined and limited circumstances.
