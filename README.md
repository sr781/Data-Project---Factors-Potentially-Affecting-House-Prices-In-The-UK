# Data-Project - Factors-Potentially-Affecting-House-Prices-In-The-UK

# Overview
The goal of this project is to identify trends for the factors affecting housing prices in the UK

# Getting Started

1. Clone this repo or download it into your local machine 
2. Open it up in Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Make sure you have added the three csv files (there are also download links in the 'ipynb' file')
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the code

# Conclusion
The two factors we looked at that may effect house prices in this report is migration and the rate of rental inflation. As seen from this report, there is an overall rising trend in average uk housing prices and that with the always positive net migration and rental inflation is a strong potential contributing factor.

Of course correlation does not imply causation and there are many other factors not considered in this such as avaliable housing stock, what percentage of houses are being bought by people, corporations and multi home landlords etc that just could not be analysed due to the time frame of this report.

However by demonstarting the ability to take multiple data sources, clean it and format it in a way so it can be presented on a graph to be studied shows that I can work with data and develop my skills to set me up to to work with more complex problems in the future.
